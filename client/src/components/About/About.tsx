                    The idea of combining shooting and xc-skiing has developed over hundreds of years. In arctic conditions soldiers or hunters had to aim at possibly moving targets after tough skiing in the deep snow.
                    The first biathlon-like competition ever was held in 1767 between Norwegian border guards.

                    <p>
                        Modern biathlon has developed in the 20th-century mainly in Sweden. An early variant of biathlon was called the military patrol skiing and it made its Olympic debut in 1924 at Chamonix.

                    </p>
                    <p>The first world championships took place in Saalfelden, Austria in 1958. First olympic appearance under the name of Biathlon gone down in Squaw Valley 1960. </p>

                    <p>Women got their first World Championships medals in 1984 and Olympic medals in 1992.

                    Military rifle was substituted out for .22 Long rifle in 1978 and at the same time the shoooting distance was reduced from 150m to the current 50m.
                    The last and the biggest step of becoming modern Biathlon was the change of skiing techinque from classic to freestyle in 1985.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>Modern Biathlon</h3>
                <p>As the skiing techinque changed to skating it marked also the start of the modern biathlon era. The biathlon our generation knows has shaped during hundreds of years but what exactly is biathlon nowadays?
                    It is a sport where the athlete carries a .22 Long rifle equipped with a harness on his/her's back while
                    skiing a distance anywhere from 1km for kids to 20km for the mens's individual competition.

                </p>
                <h3>Disciplines</h3>
                <p>The disciplines have varied a ton during the sport's development but as it stands there are 8 different disciplines.
                    <h4>Individual</h4>
                    <p>The individual competition for men is 20 kilometres and 15km for women. Allthough on lower level competitions 
                        (nationals etc.) it is not unusual to see shortened skiing distances due to bad weather conditions and the brutality of the 20km for men especially.
                        Individual competition is an interval start and start interval is 30 seconds. There is four shootings included and the order is prone, standing, prone and standing.
                        There is no penalty loop in use during the individual competition but every miss on the range concludes into one additional minute in the total time after finish.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Sprint</h4>
                    <p>The sprint competition has been the shortest biathlon racing distance but the supersprint took over the position in 2018.
                    For men the distance is 10km and 7,5km for ladies. The sprint is also one of the interval-start competitions. There is one prone shooting and one standing shooting and a miss means 
                    a 150m penalty loop for the athlete. 
                     </p>
                     <h4>Pursuit</h4>
                     <p>60 best competitors from the previous sprint qualify for the pursuit. The winner is out first and the others are released to the track by the time difference that they lost in the sprint.
                         For example if you were number #31 in the sprint and lost 59 seconds to the winner you start 59 seconds after the first starter and
