          device. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts
          to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our
          Service. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to
          indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept
          cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.

          We use the "visitor action pixels" from Facebook Inc (1 Hacker Way,
          Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook
          Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2,
          Ireland (“Facebook”)) on our website. This allows user behavior to be
          tracked after they have been redirected to the provider’s website by
          clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the
          effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research
          purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we
          do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data
          is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing
          you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this
          information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own
          promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage Policy
          https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. You can allow Facebook and
          its partners to place ads on and off Facebook. A cookie may also be
          stored on your computer for these purposes. The legal basis for the
          use of this service is Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f GDPR.
          You can object to the collection of your data by Facebook pixel, or to
          the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads by
          contacting the following address:
          https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads. Facebook is certified under
          the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus guarantees compliance with
          European data protection legislation
          (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active).
